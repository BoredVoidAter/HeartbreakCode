Tired of semicolons and curly braces that just can't express your inner turmoil? Ever wished your code had a little more... *drama*?

Welcome to **HeartbreakCode**, the world's first esoteric programming language inspired by the raw, lyrical honesty of artists like Taylor Swift and Olivia Rodrigo. Here, you don't just write programs‚Äîyou write anthems of love, loss, and logic.

## üé§ What is this?

HeartbreakCode is a fully-featured, interpreted programming language where the syntax is a tribute to pop music's most iconic storytellers. We've swapped out cold, impersonal keywords for the passionate, dramatic phrases that define a generation's anthems.

Instead of `var x = 10;`, you might write:
```
The story of us is "a cruel summer".
```
Instead of an `if/else` statement, you'll work through your regrets:
```
Would've, Could've, Should've (He was the one)
    Scream it out: "I remember it all too well."
What a shame:
    Scream it out: "It's a goddamn bad idea, right?"
The End.
```

This project is more than just a concept; it's a significant technical undertaking involving a custom-built lexer, parser, and runtime environment, all created from the ground up. It's an exploration of how we can bridge the gap between creative expression and computational thinking, making code more relatable, fun, and a little more ‚ú® theatrical ‚ú®.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Lyrical & Expressive Syntax:** Write code that reads like a pop song. Assign variables with `The story of us is...`, define functions as a `Verse`, and handle logic with the regret-filled `Would've, Could've, Should've` construct.
*   **Emotionally Resonant Control Flow:** Don't just loop‚Äîput it on repeat. The `Encore` keyword lets you relive memories (or mistakes) until a condition is met.
*   **Built-in I/O (Theatrically):** Don't just `print`. Instead, you can `Scream it out:`, `Whisper:`, or `Write in my diary:`.
*   **First-Class Functions (as Verses):** Encapsulate your reusable logic into a `Verse` or a `Bridge`. Call your functions with `Perform 'Verse Name'`.
*   **Built From the Heart(break):** This isn't a simple text replacement. HeartbreakCode features a custom lexer, a robust parser with an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and an interpreter that brings your lyrical code to life.
*   **Designed for Virality:** Your code is no longer just a set of instructions for a machine. It's a statement. A story. A piece of art ready to be shared on social media, making programming more engaging and culturally relevant.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to write your first hit? Getting the HeartbreakCode interpreter running on your machine is the first step.

### Prerequisites

You'll need `[Prerequisite, e.g., Python 3.10+, Rust, Node.js v16+]` installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/HeartbreakCode.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```sh
    cd HeartbreakCode
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies and build the project:**
    ```sh
    # Example for a Python project
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Example for a Rust project
    cargo build --release
    ```

### Writing Your First Ballad

1.  Create a new file with the `.hbc` (HeartbreakCode) extension. Let's call it `drivers_license.hbc`.

2.  Write your code. Let's create a program that decides if you're over your ex.

    ```hbc
    # drivers_license.hbc
    # A song about moving on... or not.

    The memory of you is 7.
    My threshold for pain is 10.

    # Are you over it? Let's find out.
    Would've, Could've, Should've (The memory of you > My threshold for pain)
        Scream it out: "Red lights, stop signs, I still see your face."
    What a shame:
        Scream it out: "Guess you're not sorry, and I'm not sorry either."
    The End.
    ```

3.  **Run it from your terminal:**

    Now, perform your masterpiece.

    ```sh
    # The command might vary based on the implementation
    heartbreak run drivers_license.hbc
    ```

4.  **Check the output:**

    The console will display the dramatic result.

    ```
    Guess you're not sorry, and I'm not sorry either.
    ```
