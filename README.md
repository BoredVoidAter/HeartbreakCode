Tired of semicolons and curly braces that just can't express your inner turmoil? Ever wished your code had a little more... *drama*?

Welcome to **HeartbreakCode**, the world's first esoteric programming language inspired by the raw, lyrical honesty of artists like Taylor Swift and Olivia Rodrigo. Here, you don't just write programs—you write anthems of love, loss, and logic.

## 🎤 What is this?

HeartbreakCode is a fully-featured, interpreted programming language where the syntax is a tribute to pop music's most iconic storytellers. We've swapped out cold, impersonal keywords for the passionate, dramatic phrases that define a generation's anthems.

Instead of `var x = 10;`, you might write:
```
The story of us is "a cruel summer".
```
Instead of an `if/else` statement, you'll work through your regrets:
```
Would've, Could've, Should've (He was the one)
    Scream it out: "I remember it all too well."
What a shame:
    Scream it out: "It's a goddamn bad idea, right?"
The End.
```

This project is more than just a concept; it's a significant technical undertaking involving a custom-built lexer, parser, and runtime environment, all created from the ground up. It's an exploration of how we can bridge the gap between creative expression and computational thinking, making code more relatable, fun, and a little more ✨ theatrical ✨.

## ✨ Features

*   **'Mastermind' Structural Pattern Matching**: Elegantly deconstruct data structures like 'Tracklists' and 'Liner Notes' by matching against their shape and values, binding variables and controlling program flow.
*   **'Safe & Sound' Runtime Security Sandbox**: A permissions-based security model for the HeartbreakCode runtime, allowing granular control over sensitive operations like file system I/O ('The Vault'), network requests ('Message in a Bottle'), and native library calls ('The Crossover').
*   **'The Choreography' Build Automation and Task Runner**: A command-line tool and project configuration for defining and running common development tasks, standardizing and automating the entire project lifecycle.
*   **'Déjà Vu': A Lyrical Machine Learning Framework**: A high-level, built-in framework for machine learning tasks, providing an expressive, lyrical API for training simple models and making predictions. Leverages existing 'Crossover' FFI to bind to high-performance, underlying ML libraries.
*   **'Dear Reader': Interactive Notebook Kernel**: Allows HeartbreakCode to run within popular interactive notebook environments (e.g., Jupyter, VS Code). Enables cell-by-cell execution, interleaving with Markdown, and rich output visualization of 'Tracklists' and 'Liner Notes'.
*   **'On The World Stage': A WebAssembly Compilation Target**: Enhances the 'Going Platinum' Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compiler to support WebAssembly (WASM) as a compilation target, enabling compilation of HeartbreakCode projects into platform-agnostic, high-performance bytecode for web browsers and other WASM runtimes.
*   **'The Chart Topper': A Lyrical Data Visualization Library**: Introduce a built-in library for generating static charts and graphs. This feature will provide a high-level, declarative API for transforming 'Tracklists' and 'Liner Notes' data into visual representations like bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts. Users can define the look and feel of their visualizations with lyrical commands, enabling them to tell a story with their data and save the output as an image file.
*   **'Passing Notes': A Distributed Message Queue System**: Implement a native system for asynchronous, inter-process communication based on a message queue pattern. This will allow separate HeartbreakCode applications to send ('Pass Note') and receive ('Listen For Note') messages via named channels, enabling the creation of robust, decoupled, and scalable distributed systems where different services can communicate reliably without direct connections.
*   **'The Music Video': A 2D Game and Animation Engine**: Develop a framework for creating 2D games and interactive animations, building upon the existing 'Stage Design' GUI toolkit. This engine will provide an event-driven game loop, APIs for sprite management and animation, simple physics, user input handling (keyboard/mouse), and sound effect playback. It will empower developers to create visual, interactive 'music videos' and simple games using expressive, lyrical HeartbreakCode syntax.
*   **'The Final Draft': A Static Analysis and Linting Tool**: Create a command-line tool that performs static analysis on HeartbreakCode projects to enforce code quality and find potential bugs before runtime. This linter, or 'proofreader', will check for common anti-patterns, style guide violations (e.g., inconsistent variable naming), and unreachable code, providing lyrical suggestions for improvement to help developers polish their code into a 'final draft'.
*   **Lyrical Syntax Tokenizer**: Implements a lexical analyzer that reads HeartbreakCode source text and converts the lyrical prose into a stream of recognized tokens. This component identifies core language keywords (e.g., 'The story of us is'), identifiers (variable names), operators, and literals (strings, numbers), forming the foundational step for code interpretation.
*   **Core Grammar Parser and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Generation**: Develops a parser that understands the foundational grammar of HeartbreakCode. This initial grammar supports variable assignment (e.g., `The story of us is 1989`) and a basic console output command (e.g., `Speak Now: 'hello world'`). The parser consumes the token stream and builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that represents the program's structure.
*   **Simple Runtime Interpreter**: Creates a basic runtime environment that can walk the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and execute the program's logic. This initial interpreter is capable of managing a simple variable scope, handling assignments, and printing the values of variables or literals to the console, allowing the first 'lyrical code' snippets to be executed.
*   **Lyrical & Expressive Syntax:** Write code that reads like a pop song. Assign variables with `The story of us is...`.
*   **Lyrical Conditional Logic:** Implement conditional branching using `Would've, Could've, Should've` for `if`, `else if`, and `else` blocks, with comparison operators like `is`, `is not`, `is greater than`, etc.
*   **Reusable 'Verses' (Functions):** Define and call functions (Verses) using `Define Verse 'Chorus': ... End Verse` and `Perform 'Chorus'` for modularity and code reusability.
*   **Array-like Data Structures ('Tracklists')**: Store ordered collections of items using bracket syntax (e.g., `The eras_tour_setlist is ['Lover', 'Fearless', 'evermore']`) and access elements by position (e.g., `the 3rd song in eras_tour_setlist`).
*   **Lyrical Looping Constructs ('On Repeat')**: Implement iterative control flow with `while`-like loops (`On Repeat as long as [condition]: ... End Repeat`) and `for-each` loops for 'Tracklists' (`For every song in eras_tour_setlist: ... End Tour`).
*   **Enhanced 'Verses' with Parameters and Returns**: Upgrade functions to support parameters (`Perform 'WriteASong' Featuring title='All Too Well'`) and return values (`The final word is...`).
*   **Built-in I/O (Theatrically):** Don't just `print`. Instead, you can `Scream it out:`, `Whisper:`, or `Write in my diary:`.
*   **First-Class Functions (as Verses):** Encapsulate your reusable logic into a `Verse` or a `Bridge`. Call your functions with `Perform 'Verse Name'`.
*   **Themed Object-Oriented System: 'Albums' and 'Records'**: Introduce an object-oriented paradigm using musical album metaphors. Users can define 'Albums' as classes, encapsulating related data ('Tracklists', variables) and behavior ('Verses'). They can then create 'Records', which are instances of these 'Albums', enabling more structured and complex program designs. This involves creating a system for class definition, object instantiation, and method/property access.
*   **Structured Error Handling: 'This is me trying...'**: Implement a try/catch/finally error handling mechanism with a lyrical theme. Code blocks can be wrapped in a `This is me trying...` block to catch potential runtime errors. A `Look what you made me do...` block can then handle specific errors, and an optional `It's over now...` block will execute regardless of whether an error occurred. This provides developers with a robust way to write resilient code that can gracefully manage unexpected issues.
*   **Key-Value Data Structures: 'Liner Notes'**: Add a new composite data type for storing key-value pairs, thematically named 'Liner Notes'. This structure, similar to dictionaries or maps in other languages, will allow developers to store and retrieve data using named keys (e.g., `the album_details are { title: 'Midnights', release_year: 2022 }`). This feature complements the existing 'Tracklist' (array) data type and is essential for modeling more complex, non-sequential data.
*   **Built-in 'Greatest Hits' Standard Library**: Introduce a standard library of pre-defined 'Verses' (functions) for common tasks, themed as the 'Greatest Hits' collection. This library will include functionality for string manipulation (e.g., 'Change The Key' for case conversion), mathematical operations (e.g., 'Calculate The Score'), and type casting (e.g., 'Rewrite History' for converting types). This makes the language more practical and powerful out-of-the-box without requiring users to write basic utility functions themselves.
*   **Collaborations: A Lyrical Module System**: Import and use 'Verses', 'Albums', and variables from other HeartbreakCode files using `Feature 'file_name'` for better code organization and reusability.
*   **The 'Afterglow': Asynchronous Operations**: Handle non-blocking operations with `wait for...` to initiate tasks and a callback block (`Then Speak Now: ... End Afterglow`) to process results, introducing an event loop for interactive applications.
*   **Decoding The Message: Advanced String Pattern Matching**: Integrate a regular expression engine for complex pattern matching, searching, and replacement on strings, framed as 'decoding hidden messages'.
*   **"The Vault": A File System API**: Interact with the local file system using built-in 'Verses' like `Read The Letter` (read file content), `Write In The Diary` (write to a file), and `Does The Vault Contain` (check for file existence).
*   **"Spill Your Guts": Interactive Console Input**: Capture user input directly from the console during program execution. Use `Spill Your Guts variable_name` to pause execution and assign user input to a variable.
*   **"Tell Me Why": Interactive Debugging**: Pause program execution at any point with `Tell Me Why`. This enters a REPL mode, allowing inspection of variable states and controlled resumption of the program, aiding in troubleshooting and understanding code flow.
*   **Built From the Heart(break):** This isn't a simple text replacement. HeartbreakCode features a custom lexer, a robust parser with an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and an interpreter that brings your lyrical code to life.
*   **The Record Label: A Lyrical Package Manager**: Discover, distribute, and install third-party HeartbreakCode 'Albums' (libraries) to foster a collaborative ecosystem.
*   **The Archives: Native Database Connectivity**: Interact with file-based SQL databases like SQLite using themed 'Verses' in the 'Greatest Hits' standard library.
*   **The Setlist: A Web Server Micro-framework**: Build lightweight, interactive web applications and APIs by defining routes and handling HTTP requests with HeartbreakCode syntax.
*   **Designed for Virality:** Your code is no longer just a set of instructions for a machine. It's a statement. A story. A piece of art ready to be shared on social media, making programming more engaging and culturally relevant.
